## Pong Game (Simple AI)
I followed a simple tutorial on YouTube which shows you how to make a two player Pong game in Python using the turtle library. I then took it a step further and developed a very simple AI which is fun to play against. The AI will make mistakes and doesn't play perfectly so the game can be competitive and the human player can beat the AI if they play well enough. I spent more time than I would like to admit playing against my own AI! Random number generation is used to allow the AI to occcasionally make mistakes. The values can be easily adjusted to make the AI better or worse at the game. This was a very fun project and I really enjoyed how easy the turtle library is to use.
