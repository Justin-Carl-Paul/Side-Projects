# Side-Projects
A repository with all of the side projects I have done since completing my software Engineering training.

## Tic Tac Toe Game (Minimax Algorithm)
I followed a great tutorial on Youtube and coded a game of Tic Tac Toe that runs with HTML, CSS and Javascript. The game includes a minimax algorithm which the player plays against. The minimax algorithm can't lose. The best you can do is tie with the algorithm! The minimax algorithm uses recursion and a decision tree to determine which moves benefit the computer the most and the player the least. I added a few aditional features such as pencil noises when you make a move.

## Pong Game (Simple AI)
I followed a simple tutorial on YouTube which shows you how to make a two player Pong game in Python using the turtle library. I then took it a step further and developed a very simple AI which is fun to play against. The AI will make mistakes and doesn't play perfectly so the game can be competitive and the human player can beat the AI if they play well enough. I spent more time than I would like to admit playing against my own AI! Random number generation is used to allow the AI to occcasionally make mistakes. The values can be easily adjusted to make the AI better or worse at the game. This was a very fun project and I really enjoyed how easy the turtle library is to use.
