# Side-Projects
A repository with all of the side projects I have done since completing my software Engineering training.

##Tic Tac Toe Game
I followed a great tutorial on Youtube and coded a game of Tic Tac Toe that runs with HTML, CSS and Javascript. The game includes a minimax algorithm which the player plays against. The minimax algorithm can't lose. The best you can do is tie with the algorithm! The minimax algorithm uses recursion and a decision tree to determine which moves benefit the computer the most and the player the least. I added a few aditional features such as pencil noises when you make a move.
